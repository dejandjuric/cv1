<body <h1>Dejan Djuric</h1>

  <p>My name is Dejan Djuric and I am a student at RMIT for Information Technology.
    My student number is s3859358.
    I am studying to be a programmer because of all the opportunities in the future.
    It is one of the few industries that will keep growing as time goes on.
    Most of all other industries are declining and being replaced by technology.

    I am living in Sydney and am 30 years old. I am currently in retail but exploring other options for careers.
    I play tennis and am also a coach too. I love to travel and visit new cultures and places.
    I am interested in becoming a app developer and also creating websites.
    I enjoy creative activities and always looking to learn something new.
  </p>
  <p>I also play and coach tennis. It's a great way to stay fit and be social,
    and have fun at the same time. With the skills I acquire studying programming I will be able to just about anything.
    The only limit is my creativity that’s why I am very excited about the course.

    My interest in IT started ever since I was 10 years old I always had an inspiration to make websites but I never got around to it.
    I never took action to learn more about IT until just now 20 years later.

    Visual Learning Style
    Another personality test:
    https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality
    Campaigner Personality
    It was interesting to learn a few things about myself that I didn't know such as that I am visual learner.
    I never previously thought about what my learning style was. One of the tests said that I am introverted and
    the other said that i am more extroverted so I am not sure which one is right. Some times i would be either One
    since it depends on the situation I am in and how I'm feeling.

  <p>Project: Create App

    A book database App where it has all the books that you own.
    The app will tell you which you have read and have a summary of the important parts
    of the book so you can remind yourself whenever you need to without having to read
    the book from the beginning. It will also have them in certain categories such as
    fiction or non fiction and a rating of your favourite top 20 books.
    I will use the MIT app inventor. I will research the best way to build a simple
    book database and set a realistic time frame to complete by.
    The project will be interesting and useful because a lot of people love to read and so do I.
    Also sometimes the books you by are all over the place some are online, others are offline
    and different apps such as kindle or kobo have different books on there.
    That creates a mess and can create confusion to some people.
    If you want to organise all your books in one space offline and online,
    that you can keep track of an app like this will solve your problem.
    People would love the idea and they can rank their favourite books and see a quick summary of the completed books
    Additionally it will be fascinating to see which books you couldn't want anything more than
    to purchase and have a rundown of your companion’s books as well so you can talk about thoughts. It will be a great venture.
  </p>
  <p>
    Features of the app are
    • A list of online books- It will show all the online books you have from a variety of different apps
    and devices in one place and be able to read them all from there.
    It will be a reader that can access all apps from android to IOS software.
    • A list of offline books will also be shown. You can see all the books you own in physical form and what date you bought them on.
    It will show you also similar books in that category that you own.
    • A notes section where you write all the important things you have read. The notes will be an addition to the summary but in your own words.
    Instead of highlighting in the physical book you just write the things you want to remember or see next time you want a rundown of it.
    • Completed books- the books that you have read and will have a link to the notes section where you can see all the most important parts of the book.
    That way you won’t have to reread the whole book again. It will come in handy when people want to know what things you remember about the book.
    • Books you would love to own- this will be the largest part of the app most likely. Instead of saving bookmarks of Amazon pages in your notes you
    instead have a list of it in the app. It would be well organised and you would have all the similar books together.
    You could rank the top 10 you cannot wait to buy and when you buy one of them you get a green tick.
    It would make you feel good and motivated to buy the other books on the list too.
    • Rank of favourite books- The ranking list of the top 20 books that you cannot wait to buy. You will list the reasons you want to read it
    and it will show you which of your friends has it. If it is an offline book maybe they will let you borrow it.
    • There will be a borrowing section where you may borrow books of your friends that are stored online. This will be a small fee that everyone pays
    that wants to have the ability to share books online with their friends. Like a p2p library where you can borrow a book for a month and then it returns to owner.
    • Each book you have read has a summary- There will be a online summary of the books you read and also you can add your own summary in your own words from what
    you thought was important in the books. It will consist of the most useful info gathered by you from those books.
    • Friend’s list- You can add friends and access their own favourite book list and borrow between each other if you get the premium service.
    • Chat- has a chat feature where you can share ideas and chat about random topics with your friends and also it will connect you with likeminded individuals.
    People that have similar book interests.

    Tools and technologies needed:
    I will build it with MIT app inventor and other free source programs I can find. I will have to learn about the process of building apps
    and most likely do a short course on it on top of the IT course I am currently in before I get started.
    . I will focus on learning to build apps so I can design it professionally and make a career out of it.
    Gather extra info from Udemy or other education software. Getting a tutor who has experience in it is also a good idea.
    I would use a database building software, cloud and MIT app to build it.
    Everything can be done online to complete the project so a good laptop or computer is required.
    If the project is successful it will impact a lot of people by its creativity and will make things much more organised.
    People will love reading even more and be able to collaborate on their ideas together with their friends.
    They will gather new ideas and information easier and be able to find like minded people quicker than ever before.
    It will help them organise their most cherished books and constantly be looking forward to the next book they want to read and explore.
